This is a solution to a [challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tip-calculator-app-ugJNGbJUX).

### Reflections
- JavaScript starting to feel intuitive now. Hurrah!
- I can think of a bunch of UX improvements but just keeping the focus on development for so kept to the design as specified. I improvised with how the 'custom' button reacts, given the design didn't specify that.

### Current process
#### Setup
1. Set up readme.md
1. Import fonts
1. Create JS files and link to it
1. Create CSS file link to it
1. Reset browser default values
1. Add color variables (I'm deliberately ignoring spacing variables for now, since I'd rather estimate pixel values)

#### Text classes
1. Set up defaults in body class
1. Set up text styles in CSS, mobile only
1. Assign CSS styles to HTML
1. Font variations for tablet & desktop

#### Main work
1. HTML structure, mobile only
1. Check HTML will work for tablet and desktop
1. CSS styling for mobile 
1. Define hover states and transitions
1. CSS styling for tablet and desktop
1. JavaScript!

### Questions
I'm learning frontend coding (and temporarily forcing myself to hand-code everything) in the belief that AI code still needs human oversight and I can't provide that oversight without coding proficiency. I wonder if even that will be true in a year though, give how people are talking about Claude Opus 4.5. I'm very interested in others' thoughts on this question!# tip-calculator-app
